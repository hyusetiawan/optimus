# OPTIMUS
OPTIMUS is an open source transformation tool using [unopico](https://unopi.co "unopico") API. 
The tool leverages Web Workers and other techniques to enable parsing of large files (up to several hundred megabytes).
This tool is free to use and pull requests are welcomed here

## Getting started
The whole app is a static site, and due to browser security restriction needs to be run from a server. Use your favorite webserver, or run `python -m SimpleHTTPServer 3000`
